        <p>So, you wanna know more about me? You'll get to eventually, but I'm not done building this website!</p>
        <p>This site is going to become a place for me to chronicle my internet rabbit holes, but right now it's still coming along.</p>
        <p>With the horrible things happening to the social medias out there, I thought "Hell, I'll just make my own place to put my thoughts out into the world. 
            Currently, I'm writing everything in html, in VSCode, which is ... Fun. 
            I'm going to impement a better way to do this in the future.</p>
